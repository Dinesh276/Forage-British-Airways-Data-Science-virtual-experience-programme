## Introduction
British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Whether it’s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.
As a data scientist at BA, it will be our job to apply your analytical skills to influence real life multi-million-pound decisions from day one, making a tangible impact on the business as our recommendations, tools and models drive key business decisions, reduce costs and increase revenue.
Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.


## Task1 : Web scraping to gain company insights
This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.
The first thing to do will be to scrape review data from the web. For this, we should use a website called Skytrax.
The team leader wants us to focus on reviews specifically about the airline itself. You should collect as much data as you can in order to improve the output of your analysis.
Once you have your dataset, you need to prepare it. We will need to perform data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis.Perform our own analysis to uncover some insights. Topic modelling, sentiment analysis or wordclouds to provide some insight into the content of the reviews.
Summarise our findings within a single PowerPoint slide, so that it can present. WE should create visualisations and metrics to include within this slide, as well as clear and concise explanations in order to quickly provide the key points from our analysis.

## Task2 : Predicting customer buying behaviour
Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. This is one of the reasons the buying cycle is very different to what it used to be. Today, if you’re hoping that a customer purchases your flights or holidays as they come into the airport, you’ve already lost! Being reactive in this situation is not ideal; airlines must be proactive in order to acquire customers before they embark on their holiday.

This task involves building a high quality predictive to predict the successful bookings using customer bookings data.
*Train a machine learning model
When data is ready for modelling, train a machine learning model to be able to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking. For this task, I have used an algorithm that easily allows you to output information about how each variable within the model contributes to its predictive power. RandomForest is very good for this purpose.
*Evaluate model and present findings
After training model, we should evaluate how well it performed by conducting cross-validation and outputting appropriate evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we created a visualisation to interpret how each variable contributed to the model.
