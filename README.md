## Introduction
British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Whether itâ€™s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.
As a data scientist at BA, it will be our job to apply your analytical skills to influence real life multi-million-pound decisions from day one, making a tangible impact on the business as our recommendations, tools and models drive key business decisions, reduce costs and increase revenue.
Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.


##Task1 : Web scraping to gain company insights
This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.
The first thing to do will be to scrape review data from the web. For this, we should use a website called Skytrax.
The team leader wants us to focus on reviews specifically about the airline itself. You should collect as much data as you can in order to improve the output of your analysis.
Once you have your dataset, you need to prepare it. We will need to perform data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis.Perform our own analysis to uncover some insights. Topic modelling, sentiment analysis or wordclouds to provide some insight into the content of the reviews.
Summarise our findings within a single PowerPoint slide, so that it can present. WE should create visualisations and metrics to include within this slide, as well as clear and concise explanations in order to quickly provide the key points from our analysis.
